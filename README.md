# Morpheus

## Introduction

Having a user friendly modern application to share ideas, knowledge, tips and
tricks, with your team makes it a breeze to keep everyone in the know.

“Morpheus” is our latest application that is both light-weight and robust allowing
you to install once and customize into a multitude of different communication
tools. Morph from an bulletin board, to a blog, to a kanban task board, or whatever
you can imagine.

With "Morpheus" you'll save time and development costs by implementing once and “morph” into your favorite suite of applications.

Setup:

- run `npm i` in both client and server
- run `cd server && nodemon index.js` to start database server
- run `cd client && npm run start` to start the app
